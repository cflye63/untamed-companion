# Hunter Rank & Mastery

Untamed has no traditional levels. Instead, hunters grow through Hunter Rank, stat development, talent unlocks, and weapon mastery earned through real hunts.

---

## Hunter Rank (HR)

Hunter Rank measures your progression as a hunter and determines what tier of monsters and gear you can realistically face.

**Starting Rank:** Hunters begin at **HR 0** with access to Tier 1 hunts and gear.

### HR Tier Bands (Core Progression Table)

| Hunter Rank | Weapon Tier Unlocks | Monster Tier Challenges |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| HR 0–4      | Tier 1 Weapons      | Tier 1 Monsters         |
| HR 5–9      | Tier 2 Weapons      | Tier 2 Monsters         |
| HR 10–14    | Tier 3 Weapons      | Tier 3 Monsters         |
| HR 15–19    | Tier 4 Weapons      | Tier 4 Monsters         |
| HR 20–25    | Tier 5 Weapons      | Tier 5 Monsters         |
| HR 26+      | Tier 6+ Weapons     | Legendary & Mythical Hunts |

## Getting Stronger (Milestone Rewards)

As you gain Hunter Rank, you unlock upgrades at consistent milestones:

### Stat Growth

**Every 4 Hunter Ranks:** Gain **2 Stat Distribution Points** to customize your character.

### Talents

**Every 5 Hunter Ranks:** Choose **1 Talent**

Talents are small passives or ability upgrades that shape your build.

### Specializations

**Every 10 Hunter Ranks:** Choose **1 Specialization**

Specializations are bigger changes that push your playstyle into a defined direction (similar to "subclasses," but without classes).

## Rank Advancement (CXP & Hunt Milestones)

Untamed progression is hunt-driven, not grind-driven.

### CXP – Creature Experience

CXP is earned by defeating large, named creatures, representing meaningful combat experience rather than repetitive XP farming.

### Default Rank Advancement

- **+1 HR** for each successful Large Hunt in your current tier
- A **Wall Hunt** (tier boss):
  - gives **+1 HR**
  - unlocks the next tier
- **You cannot exceed the top of a band until you clear that tier's Wall Hunt**

### Objective/Ecology Hunts

Objective/ecology hunts (rescue, relocate, harvest):
- grant **no HR by default**
- grant loot, intel, crafting boons
- GM may award **+1 HR** if the objective hunt meaningfully endangered the party

### Pacing Example

**HR 1 → HR 5** in about 5–6 hunts (3–4 Large hunts + the Wall).

## Proficiency System

Proficiency represents your training level in skills and weapons.

### Proficiency Tiers & Bonuses

| Proficiency Level | Bonus |
|-------------------|-------|
| Novice            | +0    |
| Trained           | +2    |
| Master            | +4    |

### How You Become a Master

If you gain the same proficiency twice (from Backgrounds, Training, Gear, Talents, etc.), it upgrades to **Master (+4)**.

---

## Weapon Proficiency

Weapon proficiency is tracked per weapon, and it improves through actual hunts with that weapon.

### Starting Weapon Proficiency

- You begin **Trained (+2)** in one weapon of your choice
- All other weapons begin **Novice (+0)**

### Earning Weapon Proficiency (Per Weapon)

| Hunts Completed With a Weapon | Proficiency Level |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| 0 Hunts                       | Novice (+0)       |
| 5 Hunts                       | Trained (+2)      |
| 10 Hunts                      | Master (+4)       |

This allows multi-weapon mastery over time, but rewards dedication.

### Example:

- Start with Greatsword → **Trained (+2)**
- Switch to Dual Blades → **Novice (+0)**
- After 5 successful hunts with Dual Blades → **Trained (+2)**
- After 10 hunts → **Master (+4)**

## What This Means in Play

Progression in Untamed has four moving parts:

1. **Hunter Rank** unlocks stronger tiers of monsters and gear
2. **Stat Points** increase your core abilities every 4 ranks
3. **Talents** provide frequent build-shaping upgrades every 5 ranks
4. **Weapon Proficiency** improves based on hunts completed with each weapon

**Your strength comes from experience, mastery, and preparation — not generic leveling.**
