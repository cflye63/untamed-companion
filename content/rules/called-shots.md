# Called Shots & Part Breaks

**Aiming for Weak Points**

## What Is a Called Shot?

A Called Shot targets a specific body part instead of the creature's torso.

You declare it before rolling.

- You are **not trying to deal more damage**.
- You are **trying to change how the monster fights**.

---

## Core Rules

When making a Called Shot:

- **Declare the part before rolling**
- Compare your attack roll against that **part's AR**
- On a hit:
  - Deal normal damage
  - Mark progress toward breaking that part

**Breaking a part causes a major behavioral shift.**

## Called Shot Penalty

Called Shots are harder to land.

**Unless otherwise stated:**

- Called Shots suffer **–2 to hit**

This penalty may be reduced by:

- Steady Aim
- Study Target
- Weapon perks
- Talents
- Environmental advantage

## What Happens When a Part Breaks?

When a part reaches its **Break Threshold**:

- The GM narrates the fracture
- The monster loses access to abilities tied to that part
- Movement or tactics may change
- Some parts drop unique materials

**You are reshaping the fight.**

## Why Use Called Shots?

Examples:

- **Break wings** to ground a flyer
- **Break legs** to prevent Sprint
- **Break tail** to remove sweep attacks
- **Break crest** to silence roars
- **Break carapace** to lower AR

**You are dismantling survival tools.**
