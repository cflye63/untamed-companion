# Stamina & Turn Economy

**The lifeblood of combat**

---

## 1️⃣ Core Philosophy: Stamina Is Tempo

In Untamed:

- **Stamina represents breath, footing, balance, and combat rhythm.**
- It is **not mana**.
- It is **not optional**.
- Running out is **dangerous**.
- Forcing stamina loss is a **valid strategy**.

> **Combat is not about trading HP.** It is about controlling exhaustion. When stamina collapses, fights end.

---

## 2️⃣ Combat Structure

### Rounds

- Each round represents **~6 seconds**.
- Combat proceeds in **Initiative order**.
- **Initiative = d20 + DEX modifier.**
- Ties → higher INS acts first.

---

## 3️⃣ On Your Turn

On your turn, you may:

### 🟢 Move

- Move up to your base Move Speed (30 ft default).
- Moving within base speed costs **0 Stamina**.

### 🔵 Action

- Attack
- Use a Technique
- Set a trap
- Interact meaningfully with environment
- Most Actions cost **1 Stamina** unless specified otherwise.

### 🟡 Fast Action

- Minor quick task (drink tonic, swap weapon, trigger ability)
- **Maximum 1 per turn**
- Costs Stamina only if specified

### 🟣 Preparation (Replaces Action)

- Costs **0 Stamina**
- Sets up a benefit for next turn or reaction
- If damaged: CON save DC 10 or lose Preparation
- You may move up to base speed while preparing
- Sprinting cancels Preparation

### ⚪ Reaction (1 per round)

- Triggered outside your turn
- Costs **1 Stamina** unless specified
- **You cannot React if:**
  - Stunned
  - Paralyzed
  - Restrained (unless feature says otherwise)

## 4️⃣ Stamina Rules

### Starting Stamina

```
6 + CON modifier (minimum 1)
```

_This is the canonical formula. Lock this. Do not change elsewhere._

### Stamina Costs

| Action                        | Cost           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Basic Attack                  | 1 STA          |
| Most Techniques               | 1+ STA (as listed) |
| Dodge                         | 1 STA          |
| Block                         | 1 STA          |
| Parry                         | 1 STA          |
| Sprint (per 10 ft beyond base)| 1 STA          |
| Stand from Prone              | 2 STA          |

### Sprinting

- You may exceed base movement.
- For every 10 ft beyond base speed: Pay **1 Stamina**.
- Difficult terrain counts as double movement before sprint calculation.
- Climbing or swimming may require Sprint cost at GM discretion.

---

## 5️⃣ End of Turn Recovery

You regain stamina based on your choices.

### Standard Turn (You spent stamina)

→ No automatic recovery.

### Controlled Turn (No Action AND No Fast Action taken)

- You may move up to base speed.
- You may **NOT** Sprint.
- At end of turn: **Regain 4 Stamina**.

_This is called a **Breathing Turn**. Breathing Turns are intentional tactical resets._

---

## 6️⃣ Short Rest

**~10 minutes of downtime.**

- Restore Stamina to full.
- Remove Exhausted condition (if not reduced to 0 HP).

---

## 7️⃣ Exhaustion State (0 Stamina)

If you reach 0 Stamina:

> **You gain the Exhausted condition.**

### Exhausted:

- Stamina is set to 0.
- You **cannot take Actions**.
- You **cannot take Fast Actions**.
- Movement is **halved**.
- Attacks against you have **advantage**.
- You **automatically fail STR and DEX saves**.

### On your next turn:

If you take no Action:

- Regain 4 Stamina at end of turn.
- Exhausted ends.

> **Exhaustion is not death.** It is collapse.

---

## 8️⃣ Monster Stamina (Unified Rule)

Monsters follow the same stamina structure:

- **Stamina = 10 + CON score.**
- They spend stamina on attacks and abilities.
- **When monsters reach 0 Stamina:**
  - They lose access to Signature Moves.
  - Movement is reduced by half.
  - They may trigger collapse behavior (if listed).

> **Monsters do not ignore stamina.** They obey the same physics.

---

## 9️⃣ Action Economy Constraints

### Hard Limits:

- **1 Action** per turn.
- **1 Fast Action** per turn.
- **1 Reaction** per round.
- Cannot stack multiple Preparations.
- Cannot chain Fast Actions.
- **Monsters are allowed more actions** depending on their tier.

_This keeps stamina meaningful._

---

## 🔟 The Combat Rhythm (Table Reminder)

Combat alternates between:

- **Pressure Turns** (spending stamina)
- **Breathing Turns** (recovering stamina)
- **Collapse States** (Exhaustion)

> **If players never feel pressure**, stamina costs are too low.
>
> **If players never need Breathing Turns**, monsters are too weak.
>
> **If players collapse every fight**, stamina costs are too high.
