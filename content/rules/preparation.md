# Preparation System

**The hunt begins before the first strike**

---

## Pre-Combat Preparation

### Trap Setting

**🪤 Unified Trap Framework**

All traps follow 5 rules:
1. Setup Method
2. Setup Check
3. Concealment DC
4. Trigger Condition
5. Effect Resolution

#### 1️⃣ Setup Methods

**A) Pre-Combat Ambush**

Used before engagement begins.

**Requirements:**
- 5–10 minutes of preparation
- Trap Kit required
- Valid terrain

**Check:**
- Tool Handling (DEX)
- or Heavy Trap Setup (STR)

**Suggested DC:**
- Simple trap: 12
- Complex trap: 14
- Elemental trap: 15–16

**On Success:**
- Trap is armed.
- Monster must make an Instinct check to detect it.
- If undetected → trap triggers on engagement.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is visible (monster avoids it).
- Or trap functions at reduced DC.

**On Critical Failure:**
- Trap misfires when combat begins (GM choice).

**B) Lure Setup (Known Sector)**

To lure a monster:
- Place valid bait.
- Make Trap Engineering (INT) vs Monster Instinct Check.

**On success:**
- Monster approaches trap location.

**On failure:**
- Monster changes sector or grows wary (+1 Sense next attempt).

#### 2️⃣ Trap Setup Checks

- **Light / Precision traps** → Tool Handling (DEX)
- **Heavy / Mechanical traps** → STR-based Heavy Setup

#### 3️⃣ Trap DC Scaling

```
Trap Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + relevant stat
```

#### 4️⃣ Trap Effects

Most traps are triggered when stepped on or upon entering a space.

**Focus on:**
- Immobilize
- Restrain
- Knock Prone
- Apply status (Burn, Shock, Bleed)
- Reduce Stamina
- Force movement
- Create terrain

**Example:**

**Shock Pitfall:**
- Target restrained
- 1d4 Electric damage per turn
- Can break free STR check DC 14

**Burn Trap:**
- 1d6 fire
- Apply Burned
- Area becomes difficult terrain

#### 5️⃣ Trap Limits

Monsters become aware of your traps. For every subsequent trap, the DC becomes lower.

---

### Weapon Buffs

**Oils & Sharpening**

#### 🔪 Sharpening

**Action:**
- Pre-combat or Preparation Action

**Effect:**
- +1 to Attack rolls
- Lasts 3 turns

**Limit:**
- Cannot stack
- Cannot apply twice
- Ends if weapon is dropped

#### 🧪 Oils

**Applied as:**
- Fast Action
- or 1-minute pre-combat action

**Duration:**
- 3 turns

**Effect:**
- Adds elemental rider or status trigger

**Examples:**

**Fire Oil:**
- On hit → +1d4 fire once per turn

**Poison Oil:**
- On hit → target makes CON save or gains Poisoned (1 round)

**Shock Oil:**
- On hit → target loses 1 Stamina

**Limits:**
- Only 1 oil active at a time
- Cannot combine oil + sharpening
- Oils consumed on use

---

## Crafting & Tools

### Trap Crafting

**Trap Crafting is how hunters build devices between hunts or at camp.**

- **Trap Setting** is tactical deployment.
- **Trap Crafting** is construction.

They are separate systems.

#### 🧰 Requirements to Craft a Trap

To craft a trap, you must have:

- **Trap Toolkit** (required, reusable)
- At least **1 Structural Component**
- At least **1 Functional Component**
- Access to a **camp or workshop**

**Structural** = frame (vines, wire, bone, metal)
**Functional** = effect source (fire, toxin, gland, bait, resin, shock core)

#### 🎲 Crafting Check

Make a:

**Trap Engineering (INT) check**

Base DC depends on trap complexity:

| Trap Type | DC |
|-----------|-----|
| Simple | 10 |
| Standard | 12 |
| Advanced | 14 |
| Rare / Elemental | 15–16 |

This keeps math predictable.

**On Success:**
- Trap is successfully crafted.
- Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + INT modifier.
- Trap lasts until used or disarmed.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is functional but unstable.
- Save DC reduced by –1.
- Trap has reduced effect (GM chooses minor flaw).

**On Critical Failure (Natural 1):**
- Materials damaged or consumed.
- Trap misfires when triggered.
- Or trap has unintended side effect.

#### 🧱 Component Framework

Instead of recipes, define roles.

Every trap has:

**1️⃣ Structure**
What holds it together?
- Vines
- Bone
- Wire
- Steel
- Resin frame

**2️⃣ Trigger**
What activates it?
- Pressure plate
- Snare tension
- Bait bite
- Tripline
- Impact

**3️⃣ Effect**
What does it do?
- Burn
- Shock
- Restrain
- Poison
- Collapse ground
- Pull target

That allows creativity without chaos.

#### Example Conversions

**Meat + Fire Source → Burn Trap**
- Type: Standard (DC 12)
- Effect:
  - 1d6 fire
  - Apply Burned
  - Area becomes difficult terrain

**Vines + Meat → Pitfall Trap**
- Type: Simple (DC 10)
- Effect:
  - Target knocked Prone
  - Movement reduced to 0 until STR check (DC = trap save DC)

**Vines + Electric Source → Shock Pitfall**
- Type: Advanced (DC 14–15)
- Effect:
  - Restrained
  - 1d4 Electric damage per turn
  - Break free STR check

#### 🔒 Important — Scaling Control

You need one more rule:

**Crafted traps cannot exceed the highest Monster Tier you have cleared.**

Prevents Tier 1 hunters from crafting Tier 5 traps.

### Monster Gear

**Kill Something Strange → Make Something Stranger**

#### 1️⃣ Core Crafting Structure

**Requirements**

To craft monster gear you need:
- 1–2 Monster Components
- 1 Supporting Material (Ore, Bone, Leather, Resin, etc.)
- Access to a Workshop or Crafting Station

Rare gear requires at least one Rare Monster Component.

**Crafting Check**

Make a:
- Tool Handling (DEX)
- or Relevant Craft Tool Proficiency (INT)

DC by Gear Type:

| Gear Type | DC |
|-----------|-----|
| Standard Armor / Weapon | 12 |
| Rare Upgrade | 14 |
| Special Set / Apex | 15–16 |

**On Success:**
- Gear is crafted
- Trait bonus applies
- Rare bonuses activate

**On Failure:**
- Gear crafted but minor flaw (–1 durability narrative flaw or cosmetic imperfection)
- OR Requires 1 additional supporting material

**On Critical Failure:**
- Rare component wasted
- Standard components recoverable

This keeps rare parts meaningful.

#### 2️⃣ Monster Crafting Philosophy

Every monster provides:
- Light Armor Set
- Medium Armor Set
- Heavy Armor Set
- 1 Special Set (rare component required)

Apex monsters:
- Special Set per weight class

**No branching trees. No crafting bloat.**

Each monster = 4–6 meaningful pieces max.

#### 3️⃣ Armor Template

**Base Armor Values:**
- Light → +2 AR
- Medium → +3 AR
- Heavy → +4 AR

Each armor must include:
- Base AR
- 1 Weight-Class Bonus
- 1 Monster Trait Bonus

Rare Set adds:
- 1 Rare Perk

Never more than that.

#### 4️⃣ Weight Class Bonus Framework

**Light Armor Pattern**

Mobility perk:
- +5 ft movement
- Advantage on Stealth
- +1 to DEX saves
- Ignore difficult terrain once per turn

**Medium Armor Pattern**

Stability perk:
- Minor resistance (once per turn reduce damage by 2)
- Climb or swim boost
- +1 to forced movement saves

**Heavy Armor Pattern**

Control perk:
- Reduce incoming damage by 1
- Advantage vs knockdown
- +1 AR while stationary
- Cannot be shoved easily

#### 5️⃣ Monster Trait Conversion Rule

**This is your most important rule.**

Ask: **"What does this creature do repeatedly in combat?"**

That becomes the trait.

**Examples:**
- Climber → Climb bonus
- Burrower → Ignore rough terrain
- Flyer → Glide or fall resistance
- Ambusher → First turn bonus
- Poison creature → Debuff resistance
- Rage creature → HP-threshold ability
- Mud creature → Wet terrain synergy

**Never invent traits unrelated to behavior.**

#### 6️⃣ Rare Parts — Hard Limits

Rare parts can grant ONE of the following:
- +1 to one Stat (cap 1 per character from gear)
- +1 AR (cap 1 from gear total)
- +1 Stamina regen (cap 1 total)
- +1 Power Die for one weapon type
- Gain 1 Passive Resistance
- Gain 1 Special Action (1/rest)

**Rare perks must:**
- Not stack infinitely
- Not increase Action economy
- Not increase Stamina pool
- Not exceed +1 numerical bonus

This prevents runaway scaling.

#### 7️⃣ Weapon Crafting

**Core Rule:** Any monster can craft any weapon.

The weapon inherits:
- Monster Theme
- Tier Scaling (based on Hunter Rank band)
- One Monster Trait Ability

**Standard Monster Weapon**

Includes:
- Base weapon stats
- 1 Monster Trait perk

**Rare Weapon**

Requires rare part.

Includes:
- Base weapon stats
- 1 Trait perk
- 1 Rare perk OR 1 Special Action (1/rest)

Never both.

#### 8️⃣ Special Weapon Categories

**Wands**
- Theme-based detonation or elemental rider.

**Hunting Flutes**
- 2 Songs per monster
- Apex → 3 Songs
- Songs must echo behavior (regen, haste, roar, stealth).

**Bows**
- Monster defines arrow types.
- Standard → 2 arrow types
- Rare → 3 arrow types
- No expanding beyond 3.

#### 9️⃣ Upgrade Path

Gear can be upgraded only when:
- You hunt stronger variants
- You obtain rare cores
- You clear next HR band

Upgrade adds:
- 1 numerical improvement OR Enhances existing perk

**Never add new perks after crafting.**

Upgrades refine — not expand.

### Potions & Salves

**Field Alchemy of the Wild**

- **Potions** are fast, drinkable effects.
- **Salves** are applied preparations that last over time.

Crafting happens at camp or during downtime unless otherwise stated.

#### 🧪 Crafting Requirements

**To craft a Potion, you need:**
- 1 Herb or Root (primary effect)
- 1 Liquid Source (water, essence, honey, monster fluid)
- Mortar & Pestle (required tool)

**To craft a Salve, you need:**
- 1 Fat or Resin Base
- 1 Medicinal Herb or Gland
- Application takes 1 turn

#### 🎲 Crafting Check

Make a:

**Herbalism or Resource ID (INT) check**
- DC 10 (Basic)
- DC 12 (Enhanced)
- DC 14+ (Rare or monster-enhanced)

**On Success:**
- Potion or salve crafted.

**On Failure:**
- Potion functions at minimum value (no bonus die, no extra effect).

**On Critical Failure:**
- Materials wasted.

Keep it simple.

#### 🧴 Potions (Drinks)

Drinking a potion = **Fast Action**.

Only one potion effect may be active at a time unless stated otherwise.

**Healing Potion**
- Basic Herb + Clean Water
- Restore: **1d6 + CON modifier HP**

**Super Potion**
- Herb + Honey or Essence
- Restore: **2d6 + CON modifier HP**
- Additionally: Remove 1 minor status (Poisoned, Burned, Dazed).

**Stamina Tonic**
- Fireroot + Monster Gland
- Restore: **1d4 + CON modifier Stamina**

**Super Tonic**
- Tonic + Resin
- Restore: **1d6 Stamina**
- Additionally: Clear 1 level of Exhaustion.
- Limit: Once per hunter per day.

#### 🧴 Salves (Applied Effects)

Applying a salve takes **1 Action**.

Only one salve may be active at a time.

Duration: **3 rounds** unless stated otherwise.

**Healing Salve**
- Recover: **1d4 HP** at the start of each turn for 3 rounds

**Burn Salve**
- For 3 rounds:
  - Reduce incoming Fire damage by 2
  - Prevent Burned status once

**Stamina Balm**
- For 3 rounds:
  - +1 Stamina regeneration at end of turn

**Venom Salve**
- Choose one on application:
  - Gain Resistance to Poison for 3 rounds
  - OR Coat weapon: On next hit, target makes CON save or becomes Poisoned (1 round)

#### 🔒 Consistency Rules

To keep balance tight, include these global rules:

- Only 1 Potion effect active at a time
- Only 1 Salve effect active at a time
- Potion + Salve may stack
- Effects do not stack with identical effects
- Healing from potions cannot exceed max HP
- Stamina restored cannot exceed max Stamina

### Toolkits

**Specialized Equipment for Survival & Craft**

Toolkits are reusable gear items that:
- Enable specific crafting actions
- Grant advantage or bonuses to related checks
- Unlock certain field capabilities
- Reduce risk during preparation

**Toolkits do not grant passive combat bonuses.** They reinforce the preparation loop.

#### Tool Proficiencies

Tool Proficiencies represent training with specialized kits used for crafting, survival prep, and field problem-solving.

**How Tool Proficiency Works**

When you use a tool for a task it covers, you may add your Proficiency bonus:

```
d20 + relevant Stat Modifier + Proficiency (if trained with that tool)
```

Tool tasks usually use:
- **DEX** for hands-on handling (setup, delicate work)
- **INT** for design/crafting (engineering, alchemy)
- **INS** for wilderness/camp skills (forage, navigate, track)
- **CON/STR** only when a tool's job is brute effort (heavy trap rigging, hauling)

Tool proficiency uses the same tiers:
- **Novice**: +0
- **Trained**: +2
- **Master**: +4 (if gained twice from different sources)

**Gaining Tool Proficiencies**

You gain tool proficiencies during character creation and progression:

**At Character Creation:**
- **Race**: Some races grant a tool proficiency
- **Background**: A background may grant tool proficiency when it fits
- **Free Pick**: Every hunter chooses 1 tool proficiency from the Common Tools list

**Mastery Upgrade:**
If you gain the same tool proficiency twice, it becomes **Master (+4)**.

**Using Tools in Play**

Do you need the physical kit?

Use this simple rule:
- **If you don't have the kit**: Roll at disadvantage OR DC increases by +2
- **If you have the kit**: Normal roll
- **If you're proficient and have the kit**: Normal roll + proficiency

#### 📦 Toolkit Categories

**Waterproofing & Resin Kit**
- Grants: Protect 1 Gear item from weather penalties per hunt

**🎭 Utility & Communication**

**Signal & Dye Kit**
- Grants: Mark sectors, Advantage when following your own marked trail

#### 📏 Design Rules for Toolkits

To keep this clean and balanced:

1. Toolkits never increase attack or damage rolls directly
2. Toolkits reduce risk, not inflate numbers
3. Toolkits grant advantage OR small bonuses, never both
4. Toolkits are reusable
5. Carrying too many consumes Gear Slots

#### 🎒 Slot Clarification

Toolkits count as:
- **1 Gear Slot** (major kit) OR
- **1 Pack Slot** (minor kit)

**Major kits:** Trap Kit, Smith Tools, Herbalism Kit

**Minor kits:** Signal Kit, Fishing Tackle, Stitcher Roll

This forces loadout decisions.

### Upgrades

**Monster Gear Upgrades**

There are no upgrade trees. There are only two states:
- **Standard**
- **Rare**

#### 🛠 Upgrade Rule

If you already own a Standard version of a monster's gear:

And you obtain the required **Rare Monster Component**,

You may upgrade that item to its **Rare version**.

#### 🧱 What Changes on Upgrade?

Upgrading does ONE of the following:
- Add 1 Rare Perk
- OR Enhance the existing Monster Trait

**Never both.**

**Example:**

**Standard Tanuza Blade:**
- +1 Speed when repositioning

**Rare Upgrade:**
- +1 Speed becomes **+2 Speed**
- OR Gain 1/rest Glide Slash (special action)

Choose one.

#### 🛡 Armor Upgrade Rule

**Standard Armor:**
- Base AR
- Weight Bonus
- Monster Trait

**Rare Upgrade:**

Add:
- 1 Rare Perk

**Examples of Rare Perks:**
- +1 AR (cap 1 from gear total)
- +1 Stamina Regen (cap 1 total)
- +1 to a Stat (cap +2 total from gear)
- Gain 1 Minor Resistance
- Gain 1 Special Action (1/rest)

**Rare never increases AR beyond +1 total across all gear.**

That cap protects scaling.

#### ⚔ Weapon Upgrade Rule

**Standard Weapon:**
- Base weapon stats
- 1 Monster Trait perk

**Rare Upgrade:**

Choose ONE:
- Add elemental rider
- Add special action (1/rest)
- Improve Power Die by +1 step (if system supports it)
- Add conditional effect (bleed on crit, stamina drain on hit, etc.)

**Never stack two rare effects on one weapon.**

## Inventory & Load

### Gear Slots

**Base Carry Limit**

Each hunter has:
- **6 Gear Slots** (Weapons, Armor, Major Tools)
- **10 Pack Slots** (Potions, traps, materials, bait, small tools, food, etc.)

You begin with a Standard Hunter's Pack.

#### What Is a Gear Slot?

Gear Slots represent:
- Items worn
- Items wielded
- Large rigid equipment
- Major toolkits

Each of the following occupies **1 Gear Slot:**
- 1 Weapon (two-handed still = 1 slot)
- 1 Armor Set
- 1 Major Toolkit (Trap Kit, Smith Tools, Herbalism Kit, etc.)
- Heavy specialized gear

**You cannot "stack" items in a Gear Slot.**

#### Worn vs Packed Rule

Items in Gear Slots are considered:
- **Accessible immediately**

Items in Pack Slots require:
- **Fast Action to retrieve**

This makes loadout meaningful.

#### Stashing Gear

**At Camp or Safe Zones:**
- You may store unlimited items.

**Retrieving stored items mid-hunt:**
- Requires returning to camp or secure sector.

No magical storage.

### Pack Slots

Pack Slots represent:
- Carried items
- Consumables
- Crafting materials
- Small tools
- Bait
- Trap components

Each of the following uses **1 Pack Slot:**
- 1 Potion or Tonic
- 1 Trap (crafted and ready)
- 1 Bundle of materials (GM defined)
- 1 Monster Component
- 1 Bait item
- 1 Small toolkit (Signal Kit, Fishing Tackle, etc.)

#### Bundling Rule

To prevent micro-tracking:

**Identical small items may bundle.**

Example:
- Up to 5 Arrows = 1 Pack Slot
- Up to 3 Herbs = 1 Pack Slot
- Up to 3 Minor Components = 1 Pack Slot

**But:**

Rare monster parts always occupy their own slot.

This keeps inventory meaningful.

#### Monster Materials

Large monster parts:
- Count as **1 Pack Slot each**.

If oversized:
- May require **2 Pack Slots**
- OR Slow movement by 5 ft

GM adjudicates based on size.

This prevents absurd hauling.

### Overload Penalties

For every 2 slots over capacity:
- **–1 Movement**
- **–1 Stamina Recovery on Breathing Turns**

Overload penalties apply immediately in combat.

**You cannot Sprint while overloaded.**

This makes overpacking dangerous.

### Bag Upgrades

Improved Packs increase Pack Slots only.

**Examples:**
- **Forager's Pouch** → +3 Pack Slots
- **Battle Harness** → +2 Gear Slots
- **Waterproof Satchel** → Protect 2 Pack Slots from weather penalties

**These do not stack infinitely — only 1 pack upgrade may be worn.**

### Dropping Gear Rules

#### Dropping a held or carried item:
- **Fast Action**

#### Retrieving a dropped item:
- Move into space
- **Fast Action to pick up**

#### Re-equipping stored Gear:
- **Action**

This prevents infinite swapping mid-fight.

#### Edge Case Clarifications

**1️⃣ Can you carry 6 weapons?**
- Yes — but no room for armor or tools.

**2️⃣ Can you carry multiple armor sets?**
- Yes — but each consumes a Gear Slot.

**3️⃣ Can traps be pre-set without carrying them?**
- Yes — if crafted earlier and placed.

**4️⃣ Can you exceed slots temporarily?**
- Yes — but penalties apply immediately.

---

## Survival & Biomes

Survival systems exist to:
- Add pressure between combats
- Reward preparation
- Make the world feel alive
- Change how hunts unfold

**They are not meant to slow play with bookkeeping.**

### Sector Movement

Biomes are divided into **Sectors**.

A sector represents:
- A distinct terrain space
- A combat arena
- A resource zone
- A narrative shift

Movement between sectors is **narrative, not grid-based**.

#### Sectors change when:
- A monster flees
- Hunters pursue
- Hunters retreat
- Environmental events trigger

#### Entering a new sector may reveal:
- Hazards
- Resource nodes
- Environmental modifiers
- Weather changes
- New tactical terrain

**That's all you need. Do not over-mechanize this.**

### Hazards

Hazards are where mechanics matter.

#### 1️⃣ Terrain Hazards

**Examples:**
- **Swamp** → Difficult Terrain
- **Cliff Edge** → Fall risk
- **Ice** → Balance checks
- **Dense Canopy** → Reduced visibility

**Resolution:**
- DEX / Athletics / Acrobatics vs DC 10–14 depending on severity.

**Failure results in:**
- Prone
- Movement loss
- Minor damage
- Stamina loss

**Keep consequences tactical — not lethal.**

#### 2️⃣ Environmental Hazards

**Examples:**
- Extreme Heat
- Freezing Winds
- Acid Rain
- Spore Clouds
- Volcanic Vents

**Resolution:**
- Usually CON save DC 12–16

**Failure causes:**
- Stamina loss
- Exhaustion gain
- Status condition

**These create pressure dials.**

#### 3️⃣ Monster-Triggered Hazards

**Examples:**
- Cave collapse
- Flooded chamber
- Burning forest
- Predators drawn to scent

**These happen when:**
- Monster hits threshold
- Players crit fail
- Fight drags too long

**They shift tempo.**

### Foraging

Foraging happens:
- During downtime
- Between sectors
- During extended hunts

#### Check:
- **Survival (INS)** → track, gather, and hunt.
- **Resource ID (INT)** → identify herbs, fruits, or reagents.

#### DC:
- **10** – Common food
- **14** – Rare herb
- **16+** – Monster-linked reagent

#### Success:
- Gain 1–2 usable ingredients.
- Identify a resource

#### Failure:
- Spoiled or useless.

#### Critical Failure:
- Poisoned OR attract nearby creature.

### Cooking & Buffs

Your cooking system is strong — but we tighten stacking rules.

#### Cooking Rules

- Takes **1 hour**
- Requires heat source
- Requires Cook's Pack
- One Cook leads
- Tool Handling (DEX) or Resource ID (INT)

**DC:**
- **12** – Routine
- **14–16** – Complex

**Success:**
- Choose 1 Meal Buff.

**Critical Success:**
- Choose 2 OR extend duration.

**Failure:**
- No buff.

**Critical Failure:**
- Food poisoning (CON save DC 12 or gain 1 Exhaustion).

#### Meal Buff Table

| Dish Type | Description | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Warm Meal | Balanced comfort food — roasted game, root stew. | +1 Stamina regeneration per turn for 1 combat. |
| Hearty Stew | Dense broth, heavy grains. | +2 HP per hour (non-combat recovery) until next rest. |
| Spiced Ration | Portable dried food. | +1 to next 3 CON saves. |
| Hunter's Feast | Luxurious or rare ingredients. | +1 to Attack & Damage rolls for first combat of next hunt. |
| Calming Tea | Herbal infusion, aromatic. | Remove 1 mental condition (Dazed, Taunted, Frightened). |
| Sharpening Broth | Salty, mineral-rich brew. | Next 3 Called Shots ignore +1 AR. |
| Storm Ration | High-energy nuts, sugars, or salts. | +2 temporary Stamina at start of next hunt. |
| Nightwatch Brew | Bitter drink brewed under moonlight. | Advantage on INS checks vs ambush for one night cycle. |

#### Meal Buff Limits

- **Only 1 Meal Buff active per hunter.**
- **Meal Buff lasts until end of next hunt.**
- **Meal Buff does not stack with identical effects.**

This prevents stacking Warm Meal + Storm Ration + Feast nonsense.

### Water & Exhaustion

Hydration is tracked only in:
- Arid biomes
- Long multi-sector hunts
- Extreme heat conditions

#### Water Rules

**1 Day without water:**
- CON save DC 10
- Failure → 1 Exhaustion

**2+ Days:**
- CON save DC 12
- Failure → +1 Exhaustion & disadvantage on STR/DEX checks

**Contaminated water:**
- CON DC 12
- Failure → Poisoned 1 hour

**Purification:**
- Requires heat or Herbalism proficiency.

### Hunt Failure

**Hunt Failure Consequences**

On failure, choose 1:
- Monster relocates to harder sector
- Weather worsens
- Rival predator enters biome
- Resource nodes depleted

### Retreat

#### Retreating:
- Ends combat
- Monster relocates
- Hunters keep gathered materials
- Rare part chance reduced by 1 step

**Retreat does not grant HR.**
