# Preparation System

**The hunt begins before the first strike**

## Pre-Combat Preparation

### Trap Setting

**🪤 Unified Trap Framework**

All traps follow 5 rules:
1. Setup Method
2. Setup Check
3. Concealment DC
4. Trigger Condition
5. Effect Resolution

#### 1️⃣ Setup Methods

**A) Pre-Combat Ambush**

Used before engagement begins.

**Requirements:**
- 5–10 minutes of preparation
- Trap Kit required
- Valid terrain

**Check:**
- Tool Handling (DEX)
- or Heavy Trap Setup (STR)

**Suggested DC:**
- Simple trap: 12
- Complex trap: 14
- Elemental trap: 15–16

**On Success:**
- Trap is armed.
- Monster must make an Instinct check to detect it.
- If undetected → trap triggers on engagement.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is visible (monster avoids it).
- Or trap functions at reduced DC.

**On Critical Failure:**
- Trap misfires when combat begins (GM choice).

**B) Lure Setup (Known Sector)**

To lure a monster:
- Place valid bait.
- Make Trap Engineering (INT) vs Monster Instinct Check.

**On success:**
- Monster approaches trap location.

**On failure:**
- Monster changes sector or grows wary (+1 Sense next attempt).

#### 2️⃣ Trap Setup Checks

- **Light / Precision traps** → Tool Handling (DEX)
- **Heavy / Mechanical traps** → STR-based Heavy Setup

#### 3️⃣ Trap DC Scaling

```
Trap Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + relevant stat
```

#### 4️⃣ Trap Effects

Most traps are triggered when stepped on or upon entering a space.

**Focus on:**
- Immobilize
- Restrain
- Knock Prone
- Apply status (Burn, Shock, Bleed)
- Reduce Stamina
- Force movement
- Create terrain

**Example:**

**Shock Pitfall:**
- Target restrained
- 1d4 Electric damage per turn
- Can break free STR check DC 14

**Burn Trap:**
- 1d6 fire
- Apply Burned
- Area becomes difficult terrain

#### 5️⃣ Trap Limits

Monsters become aware of your traps. For every subsequent trap, the DC becomes lower.

### Weapon Buffs

**Oils & Sharpening**

#### 🔪 Sharpening

**Action:**
- Pre-combat or Preparation Action

**Effect:**
- +1 to Attack rolls
- Lasts 3 turns

**Limit:**
- Cannot stack
- Cannot apply twice
- Ends if weapon is dropped

#### 🧪 Oils

**Applied as:**
- Fast Action
- or 1-minute pre-combat action

**Duration:**
- 3 turns

**Effect:**
- Adds elemental rider or status trigger

**Examples:**

**Fire Oil:**
- On hit → +1d4 fire once per turn

**Poison Oil:**
- On hit → target makes CON save or gains Poisoned (1 round)

**Shock Oil:**
- On hit → target loses 1 Stamina

**Limits:**
- Only 1 oil active at a time
- Cannot combine oil + sharpening
- Oils consumed on use

## Crafting & Tools

### Trap Crafting

**Trap Crafting is how hunters build devices between hunts or at camp.**

- **Trap Setting** is tactical deployment.
- **Trap Crafting** is construction.

They are separate systems.

#### 🧰 Requirements to Craft a Trap

To craft a trap, you must have:

- **Trap Toolkit** (required, reusable)
- At least **1 Structural Component**
- At least **1 Functional Component**
- Access to a **camp or workshop**

**Structural** = frame (vines, wire, bone, metal)
**Functional** = effect source (fire, toxin, gland, bait, resin, shock core)

#### 🎲 Crafting Check

Make a:

**Trap Engineering (INT) check**

Base DC depends on trap complexity:

| Trap Type | DC |
|-----------|-----|
| Simple | 10 |
| Standard | 12 |
| Advanced | 14 |
| Rare / Elemental | 15–16 |

This keeps math predictable.

**On Success:**
- Trap is successfully crafted.
- Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + INT modifier.
- Trap lasts until used or disarmed.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is functional but unstable.
- Save DC reduced by –1.
- Trap has reduced effect (GM chooses minor flaw).

**On Critical Failure (Natural 1):**
- Materials damaged or consumed.
- Trap misfires when triggered.
- Or trap has unintended side effect.

#### 🧱 Component Framework

Instead of recipes, define roles.

Every trap has:

**1️⃣ Structure**
What holds it together?
- Vines
- Bone
- Wire
- Steel
- Resin frame

**2️⃣ Trigger**
What activates it?
- Pressure plate
- Snare tension
- Bait bite
- Tripline
- Impact

**3️⃣ Effect**
What does it do?
- Burn
- Shock
- Restrain
- Poison
- Collapse ground
- Pull target

That allows creativity without chaos.

#### Example Conversions

**Meat + Fire Source → Burn Trap**
- Type: Standard (DC 12)
- Effect:
  - 1d6 fire
  - Apply Burned
  - Area becomes difficult terrain

**Vines + Meat → Pitfall Trap**
- Type: Simple (DC 10)
- Effect:
  - Target knocked Prone
  - Movement reduced to 0 until STR check (DC = trap save DC)

**Vines + Electric Source → Shock Pitfall**
- Type: Advanced (DC 14–15)
- Effect:
  - Restrained
  - 1d4 Electric damage per turn
  - Break free STR check

#### 🔒 Important — Scaling Control

You need one more rule:

**Crafted traps cannot exceed the highest Monster Tier you have cleared.**

Prevents Tier 1 hunters from crafting Tier 5 traps.
