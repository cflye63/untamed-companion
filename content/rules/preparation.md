# Preparation System

**The hunt begins before the first strike**

---

## Pre-Combat Preparation

### Trap Setting

**🪤 Unified Trap Framework**

All traps follow 5 rules:
1. Setup Method
2. Setup Check
3. Concealment DC
4. Trigger Condition
5. Effect Resolution

#### 1️⃣ Setup Methods

**A) Pre-Combat Ambush**

Used before engagement begins.

**Requirements:**
- 5–10 minutes of preparation
- Trap Kit required
- Valid terrain

**Check:**
- Tool Handling (DEX)
- or Heavy Trap Setup (STR)

**Suggested DC:**
- Simple trap: 12
- Complex trap: 14
- Elemental trap: 15–16

**On Success:**
- Trap is armed.
- Monster must make an Instinct check to detect it.
- If undetected → trap triggers on engagement.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is visible (monster avoids it).
- Or trap functions at reduced DC.

**On Critical Failure:**
- Trap misfires when combat begins (GM choice).

**B) Lure Setup (Known Sector)**

To lure a monster:
- Place valid bait.
- Make Trap Engineering (INT) vs Monster Instinct Check.

**On success:**
- Monster approaches trap location.

**On failure:**
- Monster changes sector or grows wary (+1 Sense next attempt).

#### 2️⃣ Trap Setup Checks

- **Light / Precision traps** → Tool Handling (DEX)
- **Heavy / Mechanical traps** → STR-based Heavy Setup

#### 3️⃣ Trap DC Scaling

```
Trap Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + relevant stat
```

#### 4️⃣ Trap Effects

Most traps are triggered when stepped on or upon entering a space.

**Focus on:**
- Immobilize
- Restrain
- Knock Prone
- Apply status (Burn, Shock, Bleed)
- Reduce Stamina
- Force movement
- Create terrain

**Example:**

**Shock Pitfall:**
- Target restrained
- 1d4 Electric damage per turn
- Can break free STR check DC 14

**Burn Trap:**
- 1d6 fire
- Apply Burned
- Area becomes difficult terrain

#### 5️⃣ Trap Limits

Monsters become aware of your traps. For every subsequent trap, the DC becomes lower.

### Weapon Buffs

**Oils & Sharpening**

#### 🔪 Sharpening

**Action:**
- Pre-combat or Preparation Action

**Effect:**
- +1 to Attack rolls
- Lasts 3 turns

**Limit:**
- Cannot stack
- Cannot apply twice
- Ends if weapon is dropped

#### 🧪 Oils

**Applied as:**
- Fast Action
- or 1-minute pre-combat action

**Duration:**
- 3 turns

**Effect:**
- Adds elemental rider or status trigger

**Examples:**

**Fire Oil:**
- On hit → +1d4 fire once per turn

**Poison Oil:**
- On hit → target makes CON save or gains Poisoned (1 round)

**Shock Oil:**
- On hit → target loses 1 Stamina

**Limits:**
- Only 1 oil active at a time
- Cannot combine oil + sharpening
- Oils consumed on use

## Crafting & Tools

### Trap Crafting

**Trap Crafting is how hunters build devices between hunts or at camp.**

- **Trap Setting** is tactical deployment.
- **Trap Crafting** is construction.

They are separate systems.

#### 🧰 Requirements to Craft a Trap

To craft a trap, you must have:

- **Trap Toolkit** (required, reusable)
- At least **1 Structural Component**
- At least **1 Functional Component**
- Access to a **camp or workshop**

**Structural** = frame (vines, wire, bone, metal)
**Functional** = effect source (fire, toxin, gland, bait, resin, shock core)

#### 🎲 Crafting Check

Make a:

**Trap Engineering (INT) check**

Base DC depends on trap complexity:

| Trap Type | DC |
|-----------|-----|
| Simple | 10 |
| Standard | 12 |
| Advanced | 14 |
| Rare / Elemental | 15–16 |

This keeps math predictable.

**On Success:**
- Trap is successfully crafted.
- Save DC = 8 + Proficiency + INT modifier.
- Trap lasts until used or disarmed.

**On Failure:**
- Trap is functional but unstable.
- Save DC reduced by –1.
- Trap has reduced effect (GM chooses minor flaw).

**On Critical Failure (Natural 1):**
- Materials damaged or consumed.
- Trap misfires when triggered.
- Or trap has unintended side effect.

#### 🧱 Component Framework

Instead of recipes, define roles.

Every trap has:

**1️⃣ Structure**
What holds it together?
- Vines
- Bone
- Wire
- Steel
- Resin frame

**2️⃣ Trigger**
What activates it?
- Pressure plate
- Snare tension
- Bait bite
- Tripline
- Impact

**3️⃣ Effect**
What does it do?
- Burn
- Shock
- Restrain
- Poison
- Collapse ground
- Pull target

That allows creativity without chaos.

#### Example Conversions

**Meat + Fire Source → Burn Trap**
- Type: Standard (DC 12)
- Effect:
  - 1d6 fire
  - Apply Burned
  - Area becomes difficult terrain

**Vines + Meat → Pitfall Trap**
- Type: Simple (DC 10)
- Effect:
  - Target knocked Prone
  - Movement reduced to 0 until STR check (DC = trap save DC)

**Vines + Electric Source → Shock Pitfall**
- Type: Advanced (DC 14–15)
- Effect:
  - Restrained
  - 1d4 Electric damage per turn
  - Break free STR check

#### 🔒 Important — Scaling Control

You need one more rule:

**Crafted traps cannot exceed the highest Monster Tier you have cleared.**

Prevents Tier 1 hunters from crafting Tier 5 traps.

### Monster Gear

**Kill Something Strange → Make Something Stranger**

#### 1️⃣ Core Crafting Structure

**Requirements**

To craft monster gear you need:
- 1–2 Monster Components
- 1 Supporting Material (Ore, Bone, Leather, Resin, etc.)
- Access to a Workshop or Crafting Station

Rare gear requires at least one Rare Monster Component.

**Crafting Check**

Make a:
- Tool Handling (DEX)
- or Relevant Craft Tool Proficiency (INT)

DC by Gear Type:

| Gear Type | DC |
|-----------|-----|
| Standard Armor / Weapon | 12 |
| Rare Upgrade | 14 |
| Special Set / Apex | 15–16 |

**On Success:**
- Gear is crafted
- Trait bonus applies
- Rare bonuses activate

**On Failure:**
- Gear crafted but minor flaw (–1 durability narrative flaw or cosmetic imperfection)
- OR Requires 1 additional supporting material

**On Critical Failure:**
- Rare component wasted
- Standard components recoverable

This keeps rare parts meaningful.

#### 2️⃣ Monster Crafting Philosophy

Every monster provides:
- Light Armor Set
- Medium Armor Set
- Heavy Armor Set
- 1 Special Set (rare component required)

Apex monsters:
- Special Set per weight class

**No branching trees. No crafting bloat.**

Each monster = 4–6 meaningful pieces max.

#### 3️⃣ Armor Template

**Base Armor Values:**
- Light → +2 AR
- Medium → +3 AR
- Heavy → +4 AR

Each armor must include:
- Base AR
- 1 Weight-Class Bonus
- 1 Monster Trait Bonus

Rare Set adds:
- 1 Rare Perk

Never more than that.

#### 4️⃣ Weight Class Bonus Framework

**Light Armor Pattern**

Mobility perk:
- +5 ft movement
- Advantage on Stealth
- +1 to DEX saves
- Ignore difficult terrain once per turn

**Medium Armor Pattern**

Stability perk:
- Minor resistance (once per turn reduce damage by 2)
- Climb or swim boost
- +1 to forced movement saves

**Heavy Armor Pattern**

Control perk:
- Reduce incoming damage by 1
- Advantage vs knockdown
- +1 AR while stationary
- Cannot be shoved easily

#### 5️⃣ Monster Trait Conversion Rule

**This is your most important rule.**

Ask: **"What does this creature do repeatedly in combat?"**

That becomes the trait.

**Examples:**
- Climber → Climb bonus
- Burrower → Ignore rough terrain
- Flyer → Glide or fall resistance
- Ambusher → First turn bonus
- Poison creature → Debuff resistance
- Rage creature → HP-threshold ability
- Mud creature → Wet terrain synergy

**Never invent traits unrelated to behavior.**

#### 6️⃣ Rare Parts — Hard Limits

Rare parts can grant ONE of the following:
- +1 to one Stat (cap 1 per character from gear)
- +1 AR (cap 1 from gear total)
- +1 Stamina regen (cap 1 total)
- +1 Power Die for one weapon type
- Gain 1 Passive Resistance
- Gain 1 Special Action (1/rest)

**Rare perks must:**
- Not stack infinitely
- Not increase Action economy
- Not increase Stamina pool
- Not exceed +1 numerical bonus

This prevents runaway scaling.

#### 7️⃣ Weapon Crafting

**Core Rule:** Any monster can craft any weapon.

The weapon inherits:
- Monster Theme
- Tier Scaling (based on Hunter Rank band)
- One Monster Trait Ability

**Standard Monster Weapon**

Includes:
- Base weapon stats
- 1 Monster Trait perk

**Rare Weapon**

Requires rare part.

Includes:
- Base weapon stats
- 1 Trait perk
- 1 Rare perk OR 1 Special Action (1/rest)

Never both.

#### 8️⃣ Special Weapon Categories

**Wands**
- Theme-based detonation or elemental rider.

**Hunting Flutes**
- 2 Songs per monster
- Apex → 3 Songs
- Songs must echo behavior (regen, haste, roar, stealth).

**Bows**
- Monster defines arrow types.
- Standard → 2 arrow types
- Rare → 3 arrow types
- No expanding beyond 3.

#### 9️⃣ Upgrade Path

Gear can be upgraded only when:
- You hunt stronger variants
- You obtain rare cores
- You clear next HR band

Upgrade adds:
- 1 numerical improvement OR Enhances existing perk

**Never add new perks after crafting.**

Upgrades refine — not expand.
